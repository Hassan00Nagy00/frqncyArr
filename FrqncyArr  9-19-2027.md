\- Preprocessing is doing some processing steps so that we can use it alter during quries like doing Frequency Array steps so we can use it later

\- Frequency Array ( or count array ) is a method we use to count numbers exixtance or repatation of a element putting all our array (a) elements inside a new array(b) according to our elements value like 'a' has 2 in the index 5, we put 1 inside the 'b' array means we had the element 2 in the 'a' array once, each time we see 2 inside the 'a' we add +1 inside the index 2 of 'b' array

a=\[6,5,5,6,3,7,1,8\] -> b=\[0,1,0,1,0,2,2,7,8\]

a=\[2,6,3,1,1,1,1,1 \] -> b=\[0,5,1,1,0,0,1\]

its really really great way to save and reduce big of for any process, he is an example

Can we swap an elements from A with an element from B such that the sum of elements in the two arrays are equal with O(N) time complexity

A= \[3,4,7,8\] B= \[1,2,2,5\]

Solution :-

first we do the frequency array step, maype we use it later

SumOfA=22 , sumOfB=10 so the diffrence is 22-10=12

we have two arrays so we need to get close from both sides, so 12/2 =6, so we need to -6 from the big array and +6 from the small array

that we need elementOfArrayA - elementOFArrayB=6, we have to search for two elements that apply that term ( equation )

let arr = \[3, 4, 7, 8\];

let arr2 = \[1, 2, 2, 5\];

let repArr = \[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\];

let sumOfArr1 = 0;

let sumOfArr2 = 0;

for (let i of arr) {

sumOfArr1 += i;

}

for (let i of arr2) {

sumOfArr2 += i;

repArr\[i\] = +1;

}

let difBetweenArr1SumAndArr2sum = (sumOfArr1 - sumOfArr2) / 2;

let sucCheck = 0;

if (sumOfArr1 > sumOfArr2) {

for (let i of arr) {

if (repArr\[i - difBetweenArr1SumAndArr2sum\] > 0) {

console.log("success.....");

let smallerArrElemIndx = arr2.indexOf(i - difBetweenArr1SumAndArr2sum);

let biggerArrElemIndx = arr.indexOf(i);

// console.log(smallerArrElemIndx + "...." + biggerArrElemIndx);

let template = arr\[biggerArrElemIndx\];

arr\[biggerArrElemIndx\] = arr2\[smallerArrElemIndx\];

arr2\[smallerArrElemIndx\] = template;

sucCheck++;

} // need to the diffrentNo to subtract from the biggest

}

}

if (!sucCheck) {

console.log(Error);

}

console.log(arr2);
